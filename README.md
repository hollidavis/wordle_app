## What is Wordle?

Wordle is a word puzzle game where players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word. After each guess:

1. Letters that are correct and in the right position turn green.
1. Letters that are correct but in the wrong position turn yellow.
1. Letters that are not in the word at all turn gray.
   The goal is to guess the word within six tries.
